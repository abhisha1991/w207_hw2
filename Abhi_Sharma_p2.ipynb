    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

The feature space is large and its hard to generalize well with small values of K (small compared to the size of the features). We can try to increase the value of K, however, beyond a threshold - increasing K will lose its meaning. For example, it would not be useful to consider (say) 10k neighbors for a data point for classification as its not useful to consider so many neighbors (because everyone is \"close\").\n",

The generative model reaches its asymptotic faster (O(log n)) than the discriminative model (O(n)), ie, the generative model (Naive Bayes) reaches the asymptotic solution for fewer training sets than the discriminative model (Logistic Regression)\". In our dataset, we have only around 2k training examples - which is relatively small. Thus, in such a setting NB performs better than logistic regression.\n",

That is, when C is large, we're hardly regularizing the weights but when C is small, we are heavily regularizing the weights. Thus, during high regularization (C is small), we see smaller sum of squares on the weights - we're penalizing unnecessary features highly and being parsimonious. When C is large, we're allowing more features' weights to creep into the model, thus SSQ is large.\n"

The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
