    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "\n",
    "KNN doesnt perform as well due to the curse of dimensionality. As we notice, there are over 25k features in the model.\n",
    "Due to this, not only does KNN run slowest of the 3 models, but its F score also suffers. The feature space is large and its hard to generalize well with small values of K (small compared to the size of the features). We can try to increase the value of K, however, beyond a threshold - increasing K will lose its meaning. For example, it would not be useful to consider (say) 10k neighbors for a data point for classification as its not useful to consider so many neighbors (because everyone is \"close\" and a neighbor at that point).\n",
    "\n",
    "The peak value for KNN classification F score is around 0.46 at K=7\n",

    "\n",
    "The best performing logistic model is when C=0.50 with F1 score = 0.708\n",
    "\n",
    "The best performing multinomial NB model is when alpha =0.1 with F1 score = 0.79\n",
    "\n",
    "The above article describes that \"when the training size reaches infinity the discriminative model, ie, logistic regression performs better than the generative model, ie, Naive Bayes. The generative model reaches its asymptotic faster (O(log n)) than the discriminative model (O(n)), ie, the generative model (Naive Bayes) reaches the asymptotic solution for fewer training sets than the discriminative model (Logistic Regression)\". In our dataset, we have only around 2k training examples - which is relatively small, especially compared to the feature size. Thus, in such a setting NB performs better than logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship between C and SSQ**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, we can think of C as an inverse of the traditional regularization parameter, lambda. That is, when C is large, we're hardly regularizing the weights but when C is small, we are heavily regularizing the weights. Thus, during high regularization (C is small), we see smaller sum of squares on the weights - we're penalizing unnecessary features highly and being parsimonious. When C is large, we're allowing more features' weights to creep into the model, thus SSQ is large.\n"

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above, we have the n-grams (features) corresponding to the highest weights. An interesting analysis to conduct would be to see how the above answer changes when we look at absolute values of weights, compared to weights with signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon doing this analysis, we see the answer doesnt change much for the topics, however some topics start seeing \"looking for\" more often in their feature list. For example, \"talk.religion.misc\" is affected adversely, likely for the worse. Earlier, the topic consisted of ['of jesus', 'but he', 'ignorance is', 'cheers kent', 'the fbi'] - whereas with absolute weights, it looks like ['ignorance is', 'does anyone', 'cheers kent', 'the fbi', 'looking for']. We dropped the feature \"of jesus\" which we know is highly correlated with religion, to be replaced by a generic \"looking for\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprising Features\n",
    "1. \"talk.religion.misc\" has \"the fbi\" as a feature.\n",
    "2. \"cheers kent\" shows up twice in the original model, and thrice in the re-run with positive weights only.\n",
    "3. Some features are not very valuable such as \"you are\", \"are you\", \"is there\" - these are likely topic agnostic and dont provide any topic specific information, compared to say \"the moon\" in the space topic.\n",
    "4. \"looking for\" is a pretty apt feature for comp.graphics as writers are often \"looking for\" answers or recommendations to solve computer problems - so its believable that most literature would consist of this term."

The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights.

Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",

The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001)."

For C=10,000 for example - ie, when model is hardly performing regularization, we notice the vocab length is 33513 - which is almost the full vocab. We notice that the L2 model does indeed perform better with full vocab (0.617) compared to when we have regularization / reduced vocabularies (0.58). \n",
